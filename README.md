# MalwareDetection_with_Gradio-SmartWatches

Malicious software has been growing exponentially. As a result, traditional signature-based approaches especially using Machine Learning models to detect malware are being insufficient against new malware. Therefore efficient categorization of malware samples has become essential to know the basis of the behavior of malware and to fight back cybercriminals. This is where CNN comes to the scene for its fair share of value.

The agenda of the project is to work on designing an anti-malware for IoT devices, (here it is a smart watch in our project) that detects a malware based 
on efficient categorization through CNN. Deep learning classifiers, unlike more typical machine learning techniques, are learned using feature learning rather than 
task-specific algorithms. This means that instead of requiring the human operator to identify the patterns that the machine should look for, the machine will learn 
patterns by itself. In a nutshell, it can extract features and classify data into several categories automatically. 

Model is CNN-Keras.
The algorithm is effecient, however, with lack of proper sophesticated systems this was able to achieve only 65% effeciency. However, number is claimed to be a 
bigger one if this algorithm is run in proper sophesticated systems.
